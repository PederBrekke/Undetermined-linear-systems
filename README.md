# Undetermined-linear-systems

This project was completed in relations to the course TMA4215 at NTNU, Trondheim.
In this project we will work with solving undertermined linear systems, where our project contains three separate but closely linked tasks. Generally, we will try to solve a constraint optimization problem in finding $x_{min}$, this by using a range of different methods. This will in the end be applied to a more real-life problem, namely single channel source separation for images. In some settings, we will also compare our developed implementations for finding $x_{min}$, to some of NumPy's own functions. Here, we are both interested in accuracy and runtime of our functions.
